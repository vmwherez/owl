**Let's scaffold up a simple project with cmake.**

Sure, let's get started with setting up a simple project using CMake. Here are the basic steps:

	1. **Create a Project Directory:** Start by creating a directory for your project. You can name it whatever you like.

2. **Create Source Files:** Inside your project directory, create the source code files for your project. For example, you can have a `main.cpp` file.

3. **Create a CMakeLists.txt File:** Create a file named `CMakeLists.txt` in the project directory. This file will contain instructions for CMake to build your project.

4. **Edit CMakeLists.txt:** Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file and define your project. Here's a basic example:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
   project(MySimpleProject)
   
   add_executable(MySimpleProject main.cpp)
   ```

   This CMake script sets the minimum required CMake version, names your project, and specifies the source file to build the executable.

5. **Generate Build Files:** Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   This creates a `build` directory, switches to it, and generates build files based on your `CMakeLists.txt`.

6. **Build Your Project:** Now, you can build your project using the following command:

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

   This will compile your code and create the executable.

7. **Run Your Project:** Finally, you can run your project by executing the generated executable:

   ```bash
   ./MySimpleProject
   ```



**what about an example header file and so on?**

Certainly, let's expand on the previous example by adding a header file and organizing your project into multiple source files. Here's an updated project structure:

1. **Project Directory Structure:** First, create the following directory structure for your project:

   ```css
   MySimpleProject/
   ├── CMakeLists.txt
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main.cpp
   │   ├── math_operations.cpp
   │   └── math_operations.h
   ```

2. **Header File (math_operations.h):** In the `src` directory, create a header file named `math_operations.h`. This file will declare functions that you'll define in a separate source file:

   ```cpp
   #ifndef MATH_OPERATIONS_H
   #define MATH_OPERATIONS_H
   
   int add(int a, int b);
   int subtract(int a, int b);
   
   #endif
   ```

3. **Source File (math_operations.cpp):** Also in the `src` directory, create a source file named `math_operations.cpp`. This file will define the functions declared in the header file:

   ```cpp
   #include "math_operations.h"
   
   int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   
   int subtract(int a, int b) {
       return a - b;
   }
   ```

4. **Updated CMakeLists.txt:** Update your `CMakeLists.txt` file in the project root directory to include the new source files:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
   project(MySimpleProject)
   
   # Add all source files in the src directory
   file(GLOB SOURCES "src/*.cpp")
   
   add_executable(MySimpleProject ${SOURCES})
   ```

   This modification uses the `file(GLOB ...)` command to automatically discover and include all `.cpp` files in the `src` directory.

5. **Rebuild Your Project:** Follow the previous steps to generate build files and build your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

6. **Run Your Updated Project:** Run your project as before:

   ```bash
   ./MySimpleProject
   ```

With these changes, you have organized your project into separate source files, including a header file for declaring functions. This structure is more modular and easier to manage as your project grows. You can continue to add more source files and header files as needed for your project's functionality.



**how might we print the midi devices on an intel Mac system in C++?**


To print the MIDI devices on an Intel Mac system using C++, you can use the Core MIDI framework, which is available on macOS. Here's a basic example of how to do this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <CoreMIDI/CoreMIDI.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the Core MIDI framework
    MIDIClientRef midiClient;
    MIDIClientCreate(CFSTR("MIDIDeviceList"), NULL, NULL, &midiClient);

    // Get the number of MIDI devices
    ItemCount numDevices = MIDIGetNumberOfDevices();

    if (numDevices == 0) {
        std::cout << "No MIDI devices found." << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

    std::cout << "MIDI Devices:" << std::endl;

    for (ItemCount i = 0; i < numDevices; ++i) {
        MIDIDeviceRef midiDevice = MIDIGetDevice(i);

        // Get the name of the MIDI device
        CFStringRef deviceName;
        MIDIObjectGetStringProperty(midiDevice, kMIDIPropertyName, &deviceName);

        std::cout << "Device " << i << ": " << CFStringGetCStringPtr(deviceName, kCFStringEncodingUTF8) << std::endl;
    }

    // Cleanup
    MIDIClientDispose(midiClient);

    return 0;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It includes the necessary headers for Core MIDI and standard I/O.
2. Initializes the Core MIDI framework by creating a MIDI client.
3. Retrieves the number of MIDI devices available on the system using `MIDIGetNumberOfDevices()`.
4. Checks if there are any MIDI devices. If not, it prints a message and exits.
5. Iterates through each MIDI device, retrieves its name using `MIDIObjectGetStringProperty`, and prints the device name.
6. Finally, it cleans up by disposing of the MIDI client.

Compile and run this code on your Intel Mac, and it should list all the MIDI devices connected to your system.

Make sure to link your C++ program with the Core MIDI framework when compiling. You can do this with a command like:

```bash
g++ -o MidiDevices MidiDevices.cpp -framework CoreMIDI
```

Replace `MidiDevices` with your desired output executable name.


**what are some interesting convolutions we could do on an aiff to glitch or texturize** 

Working with AIFF audio files to create glitch effects or textures can be a creative and experimental process. Here are some interesting convolution techniques you can apply to AIFF audio files:

1. **Bitcrushing**: Reduce the bit depth of the audio by quantizing the sample values. This can introduce a gritty, lo-fi texture to the sound.
2. **Sample Rate Reduction**: Lower the sample rate of the audio, effectively reducing its playback quality and introducing artifacts.
3. **Reversed Playback**: Reverse the audio, creating a surreal and glitchy effect when played backward.
4. **Time Stretching**: Apply time stretching or compression to change the duration of the audio. Extreme time stretching can lead to interesting textures.
5. **Granular Synthesis**: Break the audio into tiny grains and manipulate them individually. You can change the pitch, position, and duration of each grain to create unique textures.
6. **Pitch Shifting**: Alter the pitch of the audio to create dissonance or harmonize with the original.
7. **Filters and EQ**: Apply various filters, equalization, and spectral processing to emphasize or remove certain frequencies, creating texture variations.
8. **Randomization**: Introduce randomness to parameters like volume, pitch, or panning to generate unpredictable glitches.
9. **Delay Effects**: Apply delays and echo effects with modulating parameters to create rhythmic glitches.
10. **Convolution Reverb**: Use convolution with unusual impulse responses to add surreal spatial effects to the audio.
11. **Reverse Reverb**: Apply reverb in reverse to create a ghostly, atmospheric texture.
12. **Glitch Plugins**: Explore specialized audio plugins or software designed for glitch art. They often offer a range of creative effects for audio manipulation.
13. **Layering and Stuttering**: Layer different sections of the audio, stutter specific parts, or create overlapping loops for complex textures.
14. **Noise Injection**: Mix in various types of noise, such as white noise or recorded environmental sounds, to add texture.
15. **Modulation Effects**: Use modulation effects like chorus, flanger, and phaser to create evolving textures.
16. **Resampling**: Resample the audio at different rates or with non-linear methods to introduce distortion and artifacts.
17. **Spectral Processing**: Apply FFT-based spectral processing to manipulate the frequency content of the audio.
18. **Random Sampling**: Randomly select and play segments of the audio at different positions and durations.

Remember to save a copy of your original AIFF file before applying these effects, as they can significantly alter the audio and may not be reversible. Experimentation is key to finding unique glitch textures and effects that suit your artistic vision.


**I meant using C++**

To apply interesting convolutions and glitch effects to an AIFF audio file using C++, you'll need a library that can handle audio processing. One such library is the SoundTouch library, which provides a wide range of audio processing capabilities, including time stretching, pitch shifting, and more. Below is a brief example of how you can use the SoundTouch library in C++ to glitch or texturize an AIFF audio file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "SoundTouch.h"

using namespace soundtouch;

int main() {
    // Create a SoundTouch object
    SoundTouch soundTouch;

    // Set audio processing parameters
    soundTouch.setSampleRate(44100); // Set your desired sample rate
    soundTouch.setChannels(2); // Set the number of channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)

    // Load an AIFF audio file
    const char* inputFileName = "input.aiff";
    if (soundTouch.openFile(inputFileName)) {
        // Apply processing effects
        soundTouch.setPitch(1.5); // Adjust the pitch (1.0 for no change)
        soundTouch.setTempo(1.2); // Adjust the tempo (1.0 for no change)

        // Process the audio
        soundTouch.flush();
        soundTouch.receiveSamples(nullptr, 0); // Process the entire file

        // Save the processed audio to a new AIFF file
        const char* outputFileName = "output.aiff";
        soundTouch.saveFile(outputFileName, SF_AIFF|SF_FORMAT_PCM_16);

        std::cout << "Audio processing complete. Output saved as " << outputFileName << std::endl;

        // Close the input file
        soundTouch.close();
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses the SoundTouch library to change the pitch and tempo of the AIFF audio file. You can further explore the SoundTouch library's capabilities to create more advanced glitch effects or texturize the audio according to your preferences.

To compile the code, you'll need to link it with the SoundTouch library. Ensure you have the SoundTouch library installed on your system and adjust the paths and parameters accordingly in your build process.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you can apply various other audio processing techniques provided by the SoundTouch library to achieve different glitch and texturizing effects on your AIFF audio files.


**Waveform synthesis, couldn't we use that, and a short AIFF clip**


Certainly, you can use waveform synthesis techniques to create glitch or texturize effects on a short AIFF audio clip in C++. One common method for waveform synthesis is to generate audio using mathematical functions, such as sine waves, and then manipulate these waveforms to create various effects. Here's a simplified example of how you can perform waveform synthesis and apply glitch effects to an AIFF audio clip:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to generate a sine wave
void generateSineWave(std::vector<double>& waveform, double frequency, double duration, double sampleRate) {
    double amplitude = 0.5; // Adjust the amplitude as needed
    double numSamples = duration * sampleRate;

    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        double t = static_cast<double>(i) / sampleRate;
        double sample = amplitude * sin(2.0 * M_PI * frequency * t);
        waveform.push_back(sample);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Define audio parameters
    double sampleRate = 44100.0; // Sample rate in Hz
    double duration = 5.0; // Duration in seconds
    double frequency = 440.0; // Frequency of the sine wave in Hz

    // Generate a sine wave
    std::vector<double> waveform;
    generateSineWave(waveform, frequency, duration, sampleRate);

    // Apply glitch effects here
    // You can manipulate the waveform vector to create glitches

    // Save the generated waveform as an AIFF file
    const char* outputFileName = "output.aiff";
    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName, std::ios::binary);

    if (outputFile.is_open()) {
        // AIFF file header (modify as needed)
        // ...

        // Write audio data
        for (double sample : waveform) {
            // Convert the sample to a suitable format (e.g., 16-bit PCM)
            // Write the sample to the output file
        }

        outputFile.close();
        std::cout << "Audio synthesis complete. Output saved as " << outputFileName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the output AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. We define audio parameters such as the sample rate, duration, and frequency.
2. We generate a simple sine wave with the specified frequency and duration using the `generateSineWave` function.
3. You can apply glitch effects or other audio manipulations to the `waveform` vector before saving it as an AIFF file.
4. Finally, we save the generated waveform as an AIFF audio file. Ensure you correctly set the AIFF file header and convert the samples to the appropriate format (e.g., 16-bit PCM) when writing the audio data.

This is a basic example to get you started with waveform synthesis and glitch effects. Depending on your goals, you can explore more advanced synthesis techniques and audio processing to create unique textures and glitches in your AIFF audio clips.


**I meant use the short audio sample for the synthesis**


I understand now that you want to use a short AIFF audio sample as a source for waveform synthesis to create glitch effects. Here's an example of how you can achieve this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to generate a sine wave
void generateSineWave(std::vector<double>& waveform, double frequency, double duration, double sampleRate) {
    double amplitude = 0.5; // Adjust the amplitude as needed
    double numSamples = duration * sampleRate;

    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        double t = static_cast<double>(i) / sampleRate;
        double sample = amplitude * sin(2.0 * M_PI * frequency * t);
        waveform.push_back(sample);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Load the AIFF audio sample
    const char* inputFileName = "input.aiff";
    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName, std::ios::binary);

    if (!inputFile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Read the AIFF audio data (modify as needed)
    std::vector<double> audioData;
    double sample;
    while (inputFile.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&sample), sizeof(double))) {
        audioData.push_back(sample);
    }

    inputFile.close();

    // Define audio parameters based on the loaded audio
    double sampleRate = 44100.0; // Sample rate in Hz (adjust if needed)
    double duration = static_cast<double>(audioData.size()) / sampleRate;

    // Apply glitch effects here by manipulating the audioData vector

    // Create a new waveform using synthesized audio data
    std::vector<double> synthesizedWaveform;
    generateSineWave(synthesizedWaveform, 440.0, duration, sampleRate); // Example sine wave

    // Save the synthesized waveform as an AIFF file
    const char* outputFileName = "output.aiff";
    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName, std::ios::binary);

    if (outputFile.is_open()) {
        // Write the synthesized audio data to the output file
        for (double sample : synthesizedWaveform) {
            outputFile.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&sample), sizeof(double));
        }

        outputFile.close();
        std::cout << "Audio synthesis complete. Output saved as " << outputFileName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the output AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this modified example:

1. We load the short AIFF audio sample from the `input.aiff` file and read its audio data into the `audioData` vector. You should modify the audio data reading part to match your AIFF file's format.
2. We define audio parameters (sample rate and duration) based on the loaded audio.
3. You can apply glitch effects by manipulating the `audioData` vector or using more advanced audio processing techniques.
4. We generate a new waveform using the `generateSineWave` function (you can replace this with any waveform synthesis method).
5. Finally, we save the synthesized waveform as an AIFF audio file.

Please ensure that the AIFF file format and data reading/writing are correctly handled according to your specific use case.



**aha. I think I wanted to review the waveform synthesis method, using the input waveforms to create different sounds.**



Certainly, let's review the waveform synthesis method to create different sounds using the input waveforms. In this example, I'll demonstrate how to combine multiple audio samples to create a new synthesized sound. We'll use simple addition as an example, but more complex operations can be applied based on your creative goals.

Assuming you have two AIFF audio files (`input1.aiff` and `input2.aiff`), here's how you can synthesize a new sound by adding them together using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Load the first AIFF audio sample
    const char* inputFileName1 = "input1.aiff";
    std::ifstream inputFile1(inputFileName1, std::ios::binary);

    if (!inputFile1.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the first input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Load the second AIFF audio sample
    const char* inputFileName2 = "input2.aiff";
    std::ifstream inputFile2(inputFileName2, std::ios::binary);

    if (!inputFile2.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the second input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Read audio data from the first input file
    std::vector<double> audioData1;
    double sample1;
    while (inputFile1.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&sample1), sizeof(double))) {
        audioData1.push_back(sample1);
    }

    inputFile1.close();

    // Read audio data from the second input file
    std::vector<double> audioData2;
    double sample2;
    while (inputFile2.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&sample2), sizeof(double))) {
        audioData2.push_back(sample2);
    }

    inputFile2.close();

    // Ensure that both audio samples have the same length
    if (audioData1.size() != audioData2.size()) {
        std::cerr << "Input audio samples have different lengths. They must be of the same length to combine them." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create a new vector to store the synthesized audio
    std::vector<double> synthesizedAudio;

    // Perform waveform synthesis (in this case, addition)
    for (size_t i = 0; i < audioData1.size(); ++i) {
        double combinedSample = audioData1[i] + audioData2[i];
        synthesizedAudio.push_back(combinedSample);
    }

    // Save the synthesized audio as an AIFF file
    const char* outputFileName = "output.aiff";
    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName, std::ios::binary);

    if (outputFile.is_open()) {
        // Write the synthesized audio data to the output file
        for (double sample : synthesizedAudio) {
            outputFile.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&sample), sizeof(double));
        }

        outputFile.close();
        std::cout << "Audio synthesis complete. Output saved as " << outputFileName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the output AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We load two AIFF audio samples (`input1.aiff` and `input2.aiff`) and read their audio data into separate vectors (`audioData1` and `audioData2`).
2. We ensure that both input audio samples have the same length because they need to be of the same length for simple addition.
3. We perform waveform synthesis by adding corresponding samples from both audio samples to create a new synthesized audio vector (`synthesizedAudio`).
4. Finally, we save the synthesized audio as an AIFF audio file (`output.aiff`).

You can experiment with different synthesis methods beyond addition, such as mixing, amplitude modulation, filtering, and more, to create various sound textures by combining different audio samples.




**right, like maybe crossfade between two samples**




Certainly, you can create a crossfade effect between two audio samples to smoothly transition between them. Crossfading involves gradually blending the volume of one audio sample while reducing the volume of the other. Here's how you can implement a crossfade effect in C++ using two AIFF audio samples:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

// Function to perform crossfade between two audio samples
void crossfade(std::vector<double>& audioData1, std::vector<double>& audioData2, std::vector<double>& result, double fadeDuration) {
    if (audioData1.size() != audioData2.size()) {
        std::cerr << "Input audio samples must have the same length for crossfading." << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    size_t numSamples = audioData1.size();
    size_t fadeSamples = static_cast<size_t>(fadeDuration * 44100); // Adjust for your sample rate

    for (size_t i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
        double weight1 = 1.0 - static_cast<double>(i) / fadeSamples;
        double weight2 = static_cast<double>(i) / fadeSamples;
        double sample = (audioData1[i] * weight1) + (audioData2[i] * weight2);
        result.push_back(sample);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Load the first AIFF audio sample
    const char* inputFileName1 = "input1.aiff";
    std::ifstream inputFile1(inputFileName1, std::ios::binary);

    if (!inputFile1.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the first input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Load the second AIFF audio sample
    const char* inputFileName2 = "input2.aiff";
    std::ifstream inputFile2(inputFileName2, std::ios::binary);

    if (!inputFile2.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the second input AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Read audio data from the first input file
    std::vector<double> audioData1;
    double sample1;
    while (inputFile1.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&sample1), sizeof(double))) {
        audioData1.push_back(sample1);
    }

    inputFile1.close();

    // Read audio data from the second input file
    std::vector<double> audioData2;
    double sample2;
    while (inputFile2.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&sample2), sizeof(double))) {
        audioData2.push_back(sample2);
    }

    inputFile2.close();

    // Ensure that both input audio samples have the same length
    if (audioData1.size() != audioData2.size()) {
        std::cerr << "Input audio samples have different lengths. They must be of the same length for crossfading." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create a new vector to store the crossfaded audio
    std::vector<double> crossfadedAudio;

    // Perform the crossfade effect (adjust the fade duration as needed)
    crossfade(audioData1, audioData2, crossfadedAudio, 1.0);

    // Save the crossfaded audio as an AIFF file
    const char* outputFileName = "output.aiff";
    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName, std::ios::binary);

    if (outputFile.is_open()) {
        // Write the crossfaded audio data to the output file
        for (double sample : crossfadedAudio) {
            outputFile.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&sample), sizeof(double));
        }

        outputFile.close();
        std::cout << "Crossfade complete. Output saved as " << outputFileName << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the output AIFF file." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `crossfade` function blends two audio samples by calculating weighted averages of corresponding samples. The `fadeDuration` parameter determines how long the crossfade should take, in seconds.
- We load two AIFF audio samples (`input1.aiff` and `input2.aiff`) and read their audio data into separate vectors (`audioData1` and `audioData2`).
- We ensure that both input audio samples have the same length, as crossfading requires them to be of the same length.
- We perform the crossfade effect with a specified duration of 1 second in this example. You can adjust the `fadeDuration` parameter to control the speed of the crossfade.
- Finally, we save the crossfaded audio as an AIFF audio file (`output.aiff`).

This code creates a smooth crossfade transition between two audio samples, allowing you to experiment with different durations and create unique auditory effects.
