“Bernard was right; the pathogen is nothing; the terrain is
everything.” — Louis Pasteur’s deathbed words
Winifred found an excellent source of background info about that
quote on the Wellness Directory of Minnesota website. They devote an
entire page to this fascinating bit of medical and cultural history. Here
are some excerpts:
The man after whom Pasturization is named
“...UNESCO proclaimed 1995 as “The Year of Pasteur.” Just prior to that,
Pasteur’s family proudly released his notes and research. Gerald Geison,
a science historian, was among the first people to thoroughly review
those notes. In 1995, The Year of Pasteur, Geison wrote an article in the
New York Times proclaiming that Pasteur had lied about his research on
vaccines and germs and that most of his ideas had been plagiarized
from his contemporaries. His article, “Pasteur’s Deception” claimed that Pasteur was, in the end, a
fraud...”
“...In researching medicine, following the money has always led to the truth. The money, in Pasteur’s
case, has led to unnecessary and mandatory vaccination programs. Wouldn’t we all like to own a
company that gets support from a government that will enact laws to make the purchase of our
product mandatory?
Where to begin? Well, let’s begin with the Germ Theory.
As discussed in The Lost History of Medicine, the Terrain is more important than the Germ.
Pasteur described germs as non-changeable. We know today, from the use of Darkfield Microscopes that
microorganisms are pleomorphic, that they can change and often do. A virus can become a bacterium
which can mutate into a yeast or fungus. Modern medicine has yet to acknowledge this because it would
turn the pharmaceutical interests on their backs like a helpless tortoise. Again, we follow the money....”
“...It was Bechamp who discovered the pleomorphic nature of germs, and later on Bernard described
the “milieu” or environment that affected/caused those changes. Bernard is the one responsible for
our theories today on pH and how the nature of the microorganisms change as the body moves from
an alkaline pH to an acidic pH. (This is covered in depth in our article The Lost History of Medicine.)
On his deathbed, Pasteur recanted, saying that Bernard was right; the Terrain is everything, the Germ is
nothing.
However, since the Germ is so profitable, the medical world has written off his final statements as the
madness of a dying man. We should all be so mad.
Another problem with the Germ Theory of medicine is discovered when we look at Koch’s Postulates:
•
 The germ which causes a disease must be found in every case of the disease under the conditions
which could explain the disease.
•
 The germ must not be found in other diseases or healthy people.
•
 The germ could be isolated and used to induce an experimental disease in animals which
resembles the original disease in humans.
Pasteur never quite fulfilled all the rules. He was not able to find the germ in all cases of a disease, and
this is where his research became fraudulent. Additionally, many so-called pathogenic germs are often
found in healthy people. And finally, when Pasteur passed a germ from one animal to another to cause
the disease, he did not pass the germ alone, but took some blood with it. Injecting toxic blood from one
animal to another will guarantee the receiving animal becomes sick....”
“....Pasteur instructed his family never to release his lab notes. After his grandson died in 1975, they
were finally released. This was when Professor Gerald Geison got a hold of them and presented his
findings in 1993 to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The New York Times,
seeing how UNESCO had named 1995 the Year of Pasteur, felt that this would be the proper time to
release Gerald Geison’s research.
The Myth of Pasteurization
One more thing before we go. Our second reference above makes this statement: “Pasteur developed
‘pasteurization’, a process by which harmful microbes in perishable food products are destroyed using
heat, without destroying the food.”
This is not entirely true. Pasteurization does NOT kill ALL harmful microbes in milk and it DOES harm the
milk.
In her book, The Medical Mafia, Dr Lanctôt debunks pasteurization with a one-two punch:

1. The temperature is not high enough.
2. The temperature is too high.
First off, Dr Lanctôt points out that germs that bring us typhoid, coli bacillus, and tuberculosis are not
killed by the temperatures used, and there have been a good number of salmonella epidemics traced to
pasteurized milk.
Secondly, the heating process injures the milk. She points out that pasteurization destroys milk’s intrinsic
germicidal properties, not to mention healthy enzymes. She goes on to state that 50% of milks calcium is
unusable (the body cannot assimilate it) after pasteurization. So much for all those milk commercials.
Here’s something we found online that was drawn up for a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
concerning outbreaks from pasteurized milk:
1997, 28 persons ill from Salmonella in California, ALL FROM PASTEURIZED MILK.
1996, 46 persons ill from Campylobacter and Salmonella in California.
1994, 105 persons ill from E. coli and Listeria in California
March of 1985 19,660 confirmed cases of Salmonella typhimurium illness FROM CONSUMING PROPERLY
PASTEURIZED MILK. Over 200,000 people ill from Salmonella typhimurium in PASTEURIZED MILK
1985, 142 cases and 47 deaths traced to PASTEURIZED Mexican-style cheese contaminated with Listeria
monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes SURVIVES PASTEURIZATION!
1985, 1500 persons ill from Salmonella infection
August of 1984 approximately 200 persons became ill with a Salmonella typhimurium from CONSUMING
PASTEURIZED MILK
November of 1984, another outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium illness from CONSUMING PASTEURIZED
MILK
1983, over 49 persons with Listeria illness have been associated with the consumption of PASTEURIZED
MILK in Massachusetts.
1993, 28 persons ill from Salmonella infection
1982, 172 persons ill (100 hospitalized) from a three Southern state area from PASTEURIZED MILK.
1982, over 17,000 persons became ill with Yersinia enterocolitica from PASTEURIZED MILK bottled in
Memphis, Tennessee.
It is the author’s conclusion that pasteurization is simply a quick fix that allows large cartels to profit
from the sales of milk. Instead of relying on safe, sterile handling procedures of raw milk (which would
make the costs of milk much more expensive), we’ve incorporated this quick fix, which might or might
not work, but certainly helps the cartels profit....”
