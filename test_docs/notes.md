moving forward with Falcon and Uvicorn... will need to come back to orchestration (ngnix k3s, etc)

### Scaling and deployment

In a single instance, one could use `gunicorn` in front of gunicorn.

> If you have a cluster of machines with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm Mode, Nomad, or another similar complex system to manage distributed containers on multiple machines, then you will probably want to handle replication at the cluster level instead of using a process manager (like Gunicorn with workers) in each container.

## TODOS

- [ ] enumerate features
- [ ] reimplement with better commits, refactor, add tests
- [ ] there is a data upload feature, a Weather API, map, reads markdown and ipynb...
- [ ] Redis in DSIR by downey
- [ ] collect network engineering docs
- [ ] collect stats and ML docs
- [ ] question of where additional files should live, gitignore, etc
- [ ] docstrings are in the wrong place throughout
- [ ] more clarity around quarto now that nbconvert works well on-the-fly

```

```
