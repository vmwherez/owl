`12:37p` Looking back at SIMD from this morning:

https://thewolfsound.com/simd-in-dsp/ *love this guy*

Key takeaway I remember from this morning is that SIMD instructions are platform specific (x86, ARM).

> For example, Intel has published a list of all available SIMD instructions on their architectures calledÂ [Intel Instrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html). ARM has published aÂ [similar list for ARM-based architectures](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/).


#### `12:16p` C arrays vs pointers

In olden times we used pointers to achieve performance gains. In modern times this isnâ€™t as needed. Use arrays unless you absolutely need a pointer.

`10:14a` copying tech notes out of regular journal:

- [x] Copy technical notes out into new `owl_2024.md`
	- [x] there are additional tech notes from the beginning of this year, POSIX and `vim` things which I may want to include here
- [x]  GitHub SSH key for `iSH`
	- [x] https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

- [x]  Research char ** (double pointer for char type?) using GPT
    - [x]  Create a demo for this GPT response, double_pointer


`8:52a` Definite progress made on pointers and dereferencing. A couple of notes on `vim` setup as well. Remembered `<TAB>` to page through buffers, and that `:make` is built in.

`7:37a` Working on pointers in C. Need to copy over technical notes from the last several days.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egRIkkBEttg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egRIkkBEttg) This is a dead easy intro, whereas *Learn C The Hard Way* doesn't review this so simply. I knew the stuff in this intro, but the smaller example helped me get back into a flow. Also, I got a segmentation fault, so creating a few additional demos for `ex15`. 

`5:45a` _wake_

_Woke up wondering about SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data. First result was actually WolfSound who related it to DSP, using (I think) vectors of samples?_
