`10:14a` copying tech notes out of regular journal:

- [ ] Copy technical notes out of here into new `owl_2024.md`
- [ ]  Change of pace: orchestration of `peregrine` ASGI project (`minikube`, `podman`)
- [ ]  GitHub SSH key for `iSH`

- [ ]  Research char ** (double pointer for char type?) using GPT
    - [ ]  Create a demo for this GPT response, double_pointer
- [ ]  Find the segmentation fault in `ex15` and fix it using `lldb`
    - [ ]  Also / alternatively work from `iSH` and use `gdb`

    - [ ]  Experiment with 1) watchpoints 2) breakpoints

`8:52a` Definite progress made on pointers and dereferencing. A couple of notes on `vim` setup as well. Remembered `<TAB>` to page through buffers, and that `:make` is built in.

`7:37a` Working on pointers in C. Need to copy over technical notes from the last several days.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egRIkkBEttg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egRIkkBEttg) This is a dead easy intro, whereas *Learn C The Hard Way* doesn't review this so simply. I knew the stuff in this intro, but the smaller example helped me get back into a flow. Also, I got a segmentation fault, so creating a few additional demos for `ex15`. 

`5:45a` _wake_

_Woke up wondering about SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data. First result was actually WolfSound who related it to DSP, using (I think) vectors of samples?_

*Last night at least wanted to locate this resource, even though we aren't looking at this area directly yet:* https://www.tenouk.com/cncplusplusbufferoverflow.html
