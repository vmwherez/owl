```

[How I Set Up Every Audio Plugin C++ Project with JUCE, CMake, and Unit Tests (Wolf Sound)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq7Hwt18s3s&t=409s)

`8:43a` Note, using something like the JUCE Pojucer or Steinberg project generator abstracts away the linking process, which is going to hurt later if you don't have a hands-on feel for how **static** and **dynamic** linking work, or how to wrangle your PATHs. My experience with Android comes to mind. Things like Studio and build tools like Gradle (or in this case Projucer and cmake, as well as cpm-cmake) make things easier, but don't get discouraged if something isn't configured correctly. Increase visibility and/or do things manually first.

## `2024-01-16`

`2:37a` Loaded the Steinberg SDK into Ableton and VSTGUI popped up.

Almost forgot the VCV Rack Manual:

- https://vcvrack.com/manual/DSP

### Vector instructions [¶](https://vcvrack.com/manual/DSP#Vector-instructions)

In 2000, AMD released the [AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#History_2) processor instruction set providing 64-bit wide registers and a few extensions to the existing [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) instruction set. Intel then adopted this instruction set in a line of Xeon multicore processors codenamed [Nocona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon#Nocona_and_Irwindale) in 2004 and called it Intel 64. Most people now call this architecture x86_64 or the somewhat non-descriptive “64-bit”.

The most important additions to this architecture are the [single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) extensions, which allow multiple values to be placed in a vector of registers and processed (summed, multiplied, etc) in a similar number of cycles as processing a single value. These extensions are necessary for battling the slowing down of increases in cycle speed (currently around 3GHz for desktop CPUs) due to reaching the size limits of transistors, so failure to exploit these features may cause your code to run with pre-2004 speed. A few important ones including their first CPU introduction date are as follows.

- [MMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)) (1996) For processing up to 64 bits of packed integers.
- [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) (1999) For processing up to 128 bits of packed floats and integers.
- [SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2) (2001) Extends SSE functionality and fully replaces MMX.
- [SSE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE3) (2004) Slightly extends SSE2 functionality.
- [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4) (2006) Extends SSE3 functionality.
- [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) (2008) For processing up to 256 bits of floats.
- [FMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set) (2011) For computing ab+cab+c for up to 256 bits of floats.
- [AVX-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) (2015) For processing up to 512 bits of floats.

You can see which instructions these extensions provide with the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/) or the complete [Intel Software Developer’s Manuals](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm) and [AMD Programming Reference](https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/).

Luckily, with flags like `-march=nehalem` or `-march=native` on GCC/Clang, the compiler is able to emit optimized instructions to exploit a set of allowed extensions if the code is written in a way that allows vectorization. If the optimized code is unsatisfactory and you wish to write these instructions yourself, see [x86 Built-in Functions](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-8.1.0/gcc/x86-Built-in-Functions.html#x86-Built-in-Functions) in the GCC manual. Remember that some of your targeted CPUs might not support modern extensions such as SSE4 or AVX, so you can check for support during runtime with GCC’s `__builtin_cpu_supports` and branch into a fallback implementation if necessary. It is often preferred to use the more universal `_mm_add_ps`-like function names for instructions rather than GCC’s `__builtin_ia32_addps`-like names, so GCC offers a header file [x86intrin.h](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/config/i386/x86intrin.h) to provide these aliases.

`12:37p` Looking back at SIMD from this morning:

https://thewolfsound.com/simd-in-dsp/ *love this guy*

Key takeaway I remember from this morning is that SIMD instructions are platform specific (x86, ARM).

> For example, Intel has published a list of all available SIMD instructions on their architectures called [Intel Instrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html). ARM has published a [similar list for ARM-based architectures](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/).


#### `12:16p` C arrays vs pointers

In olden times we used pointers to achieve performance gains. In modern times this isn’t as needed. Use arrays unless you absolutely need a pointer. While C handles pointers and arrays in a similar fashion, it is important to know that they are not the same. 

We can use pointers to: 
- pass large blocks of memory (like a large `struct`) to functions 
- use a pointer to a function as a dynamic callback
- converting bytes (network socket into a data structure, parsing files)
