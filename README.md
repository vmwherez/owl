# motivation

Starting around 2020 I started organizing my notes into markdown, in 2021 I went paperless with GoodNotes on iPad. 

This repo is going to be a submodule which will live in both my Obsidian vault (iCloud) and in `peregrine` to give the latter access. 

Additionally it seems Cody (AI from Sourcegraph) will be able to access.
