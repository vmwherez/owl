## motivation

Starting around 2020 I started organizing my notes into markdown, in 2021 I went paperless with GoodNotes on iPad. 

This repo is going to be a submodule which will live in both my Obsidian vault (iCloud) and in `peregrine` to give the latter access. 

Additionally it seems Cody (AI from Sourcegraph, or similar) will be able to access. 

October 2023 integrated more with [peregrine](https://github.com/vmwherez/peregrine)

November 2023 finding harmony in Obsidian.

December 2023 reorganizing again: 

- `owl` for daily capture. 

- I've gone back and forth using the wiki-link functionality. We're back to that and Zettlekasten.

- Being project based rather than topic-based helps with interwingularity.

- PDFs are ignored. Code lives in projects: `sine`, `triangle`, `posix` and `peregrine` (private).
