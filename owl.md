	- https://www.latex-project.org/get/ 
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live

So, this tool was already installed.

```
export MAGICK_HOME="$HOME/ImageMagick-7.0.10"
export PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH"

### C++
#### pointers

`5:23a` Daves Garage - mastering pointers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxHyVn0ODg The Cherno - pointers

uninitialized a null are not the same kind of pointer
void pointer? 
function pointer?

```c++
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x; // Pointer to int
*ptr = 20; // Modify the value of x indirectly through the pointer

```

- Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable.
- They can be reassigned to point to different variables or memory locations.
- Pointers can be null (not pointing to anything) or uninitialized.
- They require dereferencing with the `*` operator to access the value they point to.
###### uninitialized pointer

```c++

int* uninitializedPtr; // Declare an uninitialized pointer 
// uninitializedPtr is not pointing to a valid memory location 
// Accessing uninitializedPtr before assigning a value would result in undefined behavior


```

###### null pointer

```c++
int* nullPtr = nullptr; // Declare a null pointer 
// nullPtr is explicitly set to point to nothing, represented by nullptr 
// It's safe to check and use nullPtr without accessing memory
```

###### void pointer

```c++
void* voidPtr; // Declare a void pointer
int x = 10;
voidPtr = &x; // Assign the address of an int to the void pointer
// voidPtr can point to objects of any type, but you need to cast it to access the value
int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(voidPtr);
std::cout << *intPtr << std::endl; // Accessing the int value through casting

```

###### function pointer

```c++

// Define a function that takes two integers and returns their sum
int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Declare a function pointer and point it to the Add function
int (*functionPtr)(int, int) = Add;

// Call the function through the pointer
int result = functionPtr(5, 3);
std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

```


*Dereferencing?* 

`memset(pointer_name, 0)`

`delete[]`

*Endianness?*

#### references

```c++
int x = 10;
int& ref = x; // Reference to int
ref = 20; // Modify the value of x directly through the reference
```

- References are essentially aliases to existing variables.
- They must be initialized when declared, and once bound to a variable, they cannot be rebound to another variable.
- References are automatically dereferenced; you access the value directly.
- They cannot be null or uninitialized.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA
*Pretty much the same thing for the computer, usually. Syntactic sugar.*

- **References are automatically dereferenced; you access the value directly.**

References are easier to read. References can't be null or uninitialized. 

#### reference vs pointer

- **Mutability:** Pointers can be reassigned to point to different variables, making them more flexible in terms of what they can reference. References are fixed once initialized, providing safety but less flexibility.
    
- **Initialization:** Pointers can be null or uninitialized, but references must be initialized when declared.
    
- **Dereferencing:** Pointers require explicit dereferencing with `*` to access the value, while references directly access the value.
    
- **Syntax:** Pointers use `*` to declare and dereference, while references use `&` when declared.
    
- **Nullability:** Pointers can be set to null (nullptr) to indicate they are not pointing to any valid memory location, while references always refer to an existing variable.

#### C++

`8:04a` 

```
**Key Differences:**

1. **C++ supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ extends C by adding features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it suitable for OOP.
    
2. **Standard Template Library (STL):** C++ includes the STL, which provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms.
    
3. **Namespace:** C++ introduces the concept of namespaces to prevent naming conflicts, allowing you to organize code better.
    
4. **Function Overloading:** C++ allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists, which is not possible in C.
    
5. **Exception Handling:** C++ provides try-catch blocks for handling exceptions, while C relies on error codes and manual error checking.
    
6. **New and Delete Operators:** C++ introduces `new` and `delete` operators for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, whereas C uses `malloc` and `free`.
    
7. **I/O Streams:** C++ replaces C's `printf` and `scanf` with stream-based I/O, making it more versatile and type-safe.
    
8. **Type Safety:** C++ is generally more type-safe than C, thanks to features like strong typing, function prototypes, and better type checking.
    
9. **Header Files:** In C, header files typically have a ".h" extension, while C++ often omits the extension and uses ".hpp" or ".h" for templates.

What are some applications in DSP of these functions?

ChatGPT

Digital signal processing (DSP) relies on various mathematical functions, including step functions and impulse functions, for a wide range of applications. Here are some common applications of these functions in DSP:

**Impulse Response Analysis**: Impulse functions are used to analyze the impulse response of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. By convolving the impulse response with input signals, you can predict the system's output for any input, making it essential for system modeling and filtering in DSP.

**Convolution**: Both step and impulse functions play a crucial role in convolution operations. Convolution is used for various DSP tasks like filtering, image processing, and speech recognition. Step functions are often used to model unit sample sequences.

**Filter Design**: Step functions help in designing and analyzing filters. For example, a step input can be used to determine the step response of a filter, providing insights into its characteristics, such as settling time and overshoot.

**System Analysis**: Step responses are used to analyze system behavior, including settling time, stability, and frequency response. Step inputs can reveal a system's response to sudden changes, which is useful in control systems and communications.

**Signal Generation**: Impulse functions are used to create signals with specific frequency content. Fourier analysis can be applied to impulse responses to understand signal frequency components, enabling the generation of signals with desired properties.

**Signal Reconstruction**: In applications like audio and image compression, step and impulse functions are used to understand the effects of quantization and reconstruction. This aids in maintaining signal quality during compression and decompression processes.

**Control Systems**: Step responses are used to analyze and design control systems. Understanding how a system responds to step inputs is critical for stability and performance analysis in control engineering.

**Sampling and Reconstruction**: In digital communication and audio processing, step functions are used to understand the effects of sampling and reconstruction. This knowledge helps ensure accurate data transmission and high-quality audio playback.

**Digital Filters**: Impulse functions are fundamental in designing digital filters, such as finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Impulse responses define the filter's behavior and frequency response.

These applications highlight the significance of step and impulse functions in DSP for tasks ranging from system analysis and signal processing to control systems and communication. They provide a foundation for understanding, analyzing, and manipulating digital signals in various domains.
```

###### Heavyside function (H(x)) vs Step Function (u(t))

$$ H(x) \ \ u(t) $$

```
The Heaviside function and the step function are closely related mathematical functions used in different contexts, but they serve similar purposes. Here's the key difference between them:

1. **Step Function (u(t))**: The step function, often denoted as u(t), is a continuous function defined as follows:

    u(t) = 0 for t < 0 u(t) = 1 for t ‚â• 0

    In other words, the step function is zero for negative values of 't' and one for non-negative values of 't'. It represents an instantaneous jump from 0 to 1 at t = 0 and is used to model sudden changes or switches in a system.

2. **Heaviside Function (H(t))**: The Heaviside function, denoted as H(t), is closely related to the step function. It is defined as follows:

    H(t) = 0 for t < 0 H(t) = 1/2 for t = 0 H(t) = 1 for t > 0

    Unlike the step function, the Heaviside function has a value of 1/2 at t = 0, creating a smoother transition at that point. It is often used in engineering and physics to model systems with more gradual responses.


In summary, the main difference is that the step function makes an abrupt transition from 0 to 1 at t = 0, while the Heaviside function has a continuous, but smooth, transition through 1/2 at t = 0. The choice between them depends on the specific modeling requirements of the problem at hand.
```

###### LTI, FIR, IIR

- linear time-invariant
- finite impulse response
- infinite impulse response

###### Dirac delta vs. impulse function

```

The terms "Dirac delta" and "impulse function" are often used interchangeably, but they can have slightly different interpretations depending on the context. Let's clarify the differences:

1. **Dirac Delta (Œ¥(t))**: The Dirac delta, often denoted as Œ¥(t), is a mathematical concept used in the context of distributions or generalized functions. It's not a function in the traditional sense, but rather a distribution. The Dirac delta is defined as follows:

    ‚à´[from -‚àû to +‚àû] Œ¥(t) dt = 1 Œ¥(t) = 0 for t ‚â† 0

    The Dirac delta is concentrated at t = 0 and has an area under its curve equal to 1. It's used to model an idealized impulse or a point source in mathematics and physics. It's crucial in the theory of signals and systems, especially when dealing with continuous-time signals.

2. **Impulse Function (or Impulse Signal)**: The term "impulse function" is more general and can refer to both continuous and discrete cases. In the continuous domain, it often refers to the Dirac delta function. However, in the discrete domain, it represents a sequence of discrete impulses. For example:

    Impulse function in the discrete domain: Œ¥[n] = 1 for n = 0 Œ¥[n] = 0 for n ‚â† 0

    This discrete impulse function is used in discrete signal processing and serves a similar role as the Dirac delta but in the discrete-time context.


In summary, the Dirac delta is a specific mathematical distribution used to model impulses in continuous-time signals, while the term "impulse function" can refer to either the Dirac delta in the continuous case or discrete impulses in the discrete case, depending on the context.
```

###### the integral of the impulse function is the step function

```
From its definition it follows that the integral of the impulse function is just the step function:

Œ¥(t)dt = u(t)

Thus, defining the derivative of the unit step function as the impulse function is justified.

##### instantaneous rate of change: the derivative

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2665752/what-does-approach-zero-really-mean

###### $\delta t$

\*means the change in time, or any other variable being considered.\*\*

Then $\delta t\to0$ simply means that you are forcing two points in time closer and closer together. This is an extremely important concept because it
forms the fundamentals of calculus.

The gradient of a line is given by 1$$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$ and we can apply this to curves as well. We have $$\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ at some point $x=a$ and this is known as the average rate of change. But to find the rate of change (or slope) exactly at the point $(a,f(a))$, we let $x=a+t$ and take the _limit_ as $t\to0$. $$\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(a+t)-f(a)}{t}$$ This is known as the **instantaneous rate of change**, or more commonly, the _derivative_.

###### example

Take the function $f(x)=\sin x$ and we want to find its slope at $x=\pi$.

Then the definition of the derivative is $$\begin{align}f'(\pi)=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(\pi+t)-f(\pi)}{t}&amp;=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin(\pi+t)-\sin\pi}{t}\\&amp;=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin\pi\cos t+\sin t\cos\pi}{t}\\&amp;=-\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin t}{t}\end{align}$$ which is a very famous limit and it evaluates to $1$ (see the squeeze theorem)

Hence: $f'(\pi)=-1$.

`12a` Opened up notebook from `2006`. Mysticism, math, DSP and music theory all in one place. I signed it `6-22-06`. 

I have decided, in honor of my ancestor John Napier, to study the logarithm this evening, starting on paper and hopefully moving into a Jupyter notebook or something. 

### logarithms

*logos* *arithmetic*

`12:23a` Noting my memories of confusing `logarithm` with `alogrithm` probably 10 years ago, maybe around the time at Scrib in Boulder. I think at that time I was studying algorithms for the first time and knew they were different, but had an earlier memory of confusing both words, probably going back to middle school.  

- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/61209/what-algorithm-is-used-by-computers-to-calculate-logarithms

$$\log_216 = 4$$
because

$$ 2^4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$$
`12:36a` Interesting observation of passage of time, noticed the other night that 10min felt much longer. I looked up 'time dilation' because I wasn't sure about the usage of the word. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation

Also, thought maybe the mini was running hot, couldn't log in remote. But I had forgotten I removed the local keyboard's batteries. 
Either way, the mini is not powerful enough and I need to consolidate environments. There is still a bunch of stuff on there though. 

`12:51a` Coming up on `1a` and then it will be only a few hours until my walk. I made good first steps toward properly understand logarithms.

## about

This file was created to capture technical notes separate from personal reflection and journaling. I had been using a single daily entry to capture everything, which after a while made it difficult to refer to ongoing studies.

So, as a rule cathartic journaling and reflections on process belong in those daily entries, whereas hard information belongs here.

Additional mind-mapping, vaults organized around topic, etc are still being explored. Ex. a Math file in historical order could be split into a vault, I don‚Äôt know.

[[2023-06-15]] has some interesting chronology 
[[2023-06-04]] This file has a lot of reflection.
