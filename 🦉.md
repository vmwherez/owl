##### instantaneous rate of change: the derivative

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2665752/what-does-approach-zero-really-mean

###### $\delta t$ 
*means the change in time, or any other variable being considered.** 

Then $\delta t\to0$ simply means that you are forcing two points in time closer and closer together. This is an extremely important concept because it 
forms the fundamentals of calculus.

The gradient of a line is given by 1$$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$ and we can apply this to curves as well. We have $$\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ at some point $x=a$ and this is known as the average rate of change. But to find the rate of change (or slope) exactly at the point $(a,f(a))$, we let $x=a+t$ and take the  *limit* as $t\to0$. $$\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(a+t)-f(a)}{t}$$ This is known as the **instantaneous rate of change**, or more commonly, the  *derivative*.


###### example

Take the function $f(x)=\sin x$ and we want to find its slope at $x=\pi$. 

Then the definition of the derivative is $$\begin{align}f'(\pi)=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(\pi+t)-f(\pi)}{t}&amp;=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin(\pi+t)-\sin\pi}{t}\\&amp;=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin\pi\cos t+\sin t\cos\pi}{t}\\&amp;=-\lim_{t\to0}\frac{\sin t}{t}\end{align}$$ which is a very famous limit and it evaluates to $1$ (see the squeeze theorem)

Hence:  $f'(\pi)=-1$.
